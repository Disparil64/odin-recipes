# odin-recipes

This is my first attempt at making a basic website with HTML. 

I am going to create a website with Recipes and multiple pages with links and photos and play around with CSS. This is not intended to be a serious project or look good.It was just me playing around with CSS colors and HTML on a working webiste that links to other pages and images.
